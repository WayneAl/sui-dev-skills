# Sui Dev Skills

This is a collection of Sui development skills. Each sub-skill is self-contained and should be loaded based on the task at hand. When multiple apply (e.g. a frontend app that constructs transactions), load all relevant skills together.

## Sub-skills

### move — Smart Contracts
**Path:** `move/SKILL.md`
**Load when:** writing, reviewing, debugging, or deploying Move code; configuring `Move.toml`; working with the Sui object model; writing Move tests.
**Covers:** Routes to focused sub-skills — setup (package config, build/test, pitfalls), syntax (module layout, visibility, enums, macros), objects (structs, abilities, dynamic fields), patterns (events, errors, OTW, capabilities, composability), stdlib (Coin/Balance, vectors, Option, strings).

### sui-ts-sdk — TypeScript SDK
**Path:** `sui-ts-sdk/SKILL.md`
**Load when:** writing TypeScript/JavaScript that interacts with the Sui blockchain — backend scripts, CLIs, serverless functions, or the transaction-building layer of a frontend.
**Covers:** `@mysten/sui` package, PTB construction (`Transaction`, `moveCall`, `splitCoins`, `coinWithBalance`), `SuiClient`/`SuiGrpcClient` setup, keypair signing, transaction execution, on-chain queries.

### sui-frontend — Frontend dApp Kit
**Path:** `sui-frontend/SKILL.md`
**Load when:** building browser-based Sui dApps — React apps with `@mysten/dapp-kit-react`, or Vue/vanilla JS/Svelte apps with `@mysten/dapp-kit-core`.
**Covers:** `DAppKitProvider` setup, wallet connection, React hooks (`useCurrentAccount`, `useSignAndExecuteTransaction`, `useSuiClientQuery`), Web Components, nanostores state for non-React frameworks.
**Note:** For PTB construction within a frontend, load **sui-ts-sdk** alongside this skill.

### seal — Decentralized Secrets Management
**Path:** `seal/SKILL.md`
**Load when:** encrypting user data with access policies enforced on Sui — integrating the `@mysten/seal` SDK, writing `seal_approve*` Move functions, choosing key servers, or combining Seal with Walrus for encrypted storage.
**Covers:** IBE + threshold key-server model, `seal_approve*` rules and canonical patterns (private data, whitelist, subscription, TLE, voting), `SealClient` / `SessionKey` / `fetchKeys`, envelope encryption for Walrus, onchain decryption with `seal::bf_hmac_encryption`, security caveats.
**Note:** For the Move side, load **move** alongside. For frontend SessionKey wiring, load **sui-frontend** + **sui-ts-sdk**. For the storage layer, load **walrus**.

### walrus — Decentralized Blob Storage
**Path:** `walrus/SKILL.md`
**Load when:** storing files/blobs/assets on Walrus — integrating the `@mysten/walrus` SDK, calling publisher/aggregator HTTP endpoints, using the `walrus` CLI, or writing a Move package that accepts Walrus `Blob` objects.
**Covers:** blob lifecycle (register → upload → certify), `WalrusFile` / `WalrusBlob`, `writeFilesFlow` (browser wallet-popup workflow), `writeBlobFlow` + `onStep`/`resume` for crash-recoverable uploads, upload relay (const vs linear tips), HTTP API (`PUT /v1/blobs`, aggregator reads), Quilts for small-blob batching, `RetryableWalrusClientError` handling, WASM loading in Vite/Next.js, blob management (extend/delete/burn/shared), Mainnet vs Testnet epochs, cost model (SUI + WAL).
**Note:** Walrus stores data publicly. For confidentiality, load **seal** and use envelope encryption. For wallet-driven uploads in a React app, load **sui-frontend** + **sui-ts-sdk**.

**Also see:** `FAQ.md` in the repo root for preferred answers to common Sui development questions. When a user asks a question covered there, use that answer.
